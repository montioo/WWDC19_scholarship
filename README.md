# WWDC19 Scholarship Submission

Author: Marius Montebaur


My project is an interactive demo of a PID (proportional integral derivative) controller which can be used to control autonomous vehicles and robotic arms.

It features an explanation of the mathematics that describe the controller and two examples where a controller's behavior can be altered by manipulating its parameters.

## Download and Run

Just download or clone this repository and any recent Mac with Xcode installed should be able to open the Swift playground file `PID_Interactive_Montebaur.playground`

## Screenshots

Below are a few screenshots of the playground running.
